Hi! This is my little project for the CMPT-276 course and for those moments when you want to make your favorite person feel special.
This is a simple website with a few tabs with engaging content for your partner.
You can change the pictures, text, animations, and places to your liking.

## How to use
### Pictures
If you want to change the temp pictures, there are three different folders with pictures:
- pictures *pictures for the pictures tab*
- eating_pictures *pictures for the eating tab*
- cat_drawings *pictures of the drawn cat "Basil Leaf" that is used on all tabs for a cute touch*

There's also a seal picture for the surprise tab.

### Animations, text, and other stuff
If you want to change anything else, you can find everything in the src/app folder.

## How to run
To run the project, you need to have Node.js and NPM installed.
Download the project and open it in your favorite IDE or text editor.
Install npm packages before running the website:

```bash
npm i
```

Then, you can run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Or, if you want to deploy it on your personal VPS, you can build it:

```bash
npm run build
```

After that, you can deploy it to your server.
